# Objective - Taxonomy Made Simple
The objective of the project is to provide the marketplace with the following **open-source**, **practical tools** to advance user implementation of sustainable finance data systems into business operating models for new and evolving **taxonomy frameworks, standards, regulations & laws**:

1. **TAXONOMY FILES**: Library of Taxonomy Files - in human and machine readable format - with supporting research
2. **TAXONOMY TOOLS**: Library of Interactive Tools to Explore, Compare and Download Taxonomy Files - for human interaction
3. **TAXONOMY RESEARCH PAPERS**: Library of Research Papers providing findings, insights and recommendations on evolving Taxonomies and new ideas on Taxonomies
4. **TAXONOMY USE CASES**: Library of Real World Use Cases that explain how to solve specific business problems

## Example: TCFD, EBA and ISSB
1. **TAXONOMY FILES**: TCFD (Framework); EBA Pillar 3 (Regulation); ISSB (Standard)
2. **TAXONOMY TOOLS**: Taxonomy Mappings for the "Doubles" TCFD-EBA, TCFD-ISSB, EBA-ISSB and the "Triple" TCFD-EBA-ISSB"
3. **TAXONOMY RESEARCH PAPERS**: Research Paper presenting findings, insights and recommendations of the Mappings Analysis
4. **TAXONOMY USE CASE**: Use Case of End-to-End Lending Workflow under TCFD-EBA-ISSB, where:
    - TCFD is used as part of the Decision Criteria by a Line-of-Business for the Lending;
    - EBA Pillar 3 is used for Mandatory ESG Risk Disclosure for the Lending; and,
    - ISSB is used as the Accounting Standard under IFRS for Financial Statements Balance Sheet Reporting for the Lending

# Project Types
We expect that the taxonomy project categories will expand as the marketplace evolves. Examples include:
- **Phase 1**: Market Frameworks, Standards, Regulations & Laws - **the initial focus of the OS-SFT project**
- **Phase 2**: Market Services: e.g. taxonomies for data vendors' data service, scoring, rating and risk methodologies
- **Phase 3**: Market Financial Instruments, for example:
  - Spot Carbon, Carbon Derivatives - On-exchange, OTC, Carbon Offsets, Futures, OTC-Cleared, OTC-Uncleared
  - Bonds with KPIs, e.g. coupon resets based on carbon emissions
  - Swaps with KPIs, e.g. coupon resets and look-back payment resets based on carbon emissions
- **Phase 4**: Organisational Control Frameworks: Policies, Processes & Procedures
- **Phase 5**: Organisaitonal Risk Models: credit risk, market risk, collateral risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, etc
- And so forth ...
