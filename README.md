# OS-SF-Taxonomy-Project-Overview
START HERE: OS-SF Taxonomy Project Background and Overview

## Welcome to the first global project for
# Open-Source Sustainable Finance Taxonomy (OS-SFT)

## Background - July, 2021
The project has its origins in July, 2021 when [First Derivative](https://firstderivative.com/) and [Corlytics](https://www.corlytics.com/) had been researching how best to solve the huge issue of new data requirements for sustainable finance, including the wider ranging domains of Climate Change and ESG. The problem kept returning to "data" in its holistic sense - what data, how to find it, how to make it ready for use by financial services firms. 

We concluded that the logical way forward was to pursue an open-source agenda to create the foundation taxonomies. Such taxonomies are the bedrock of any use case, because without a robust definition of data classification (called "[taxonomies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy)"), nothing downstream can work - all reporting function, all lines of businesses and all group functions would fail on their **sustainable finance mandates**. 

On this premise, we set our **vision** to develop an **open-source project for sustainable finance taxonomies** that would help to **drive faster changes** in sustainable finance across the entire global financial system.

Following on from this vision, and inspired by the first global project for open-source climate risk modelling, [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/), we embarked on a mission to gather like-minded collaborators to create a critical mass of partners to be able to launch this site.

## Initial Funding - November, 2021
As with all projects of this nature, we needed a catalyst. This was provided in November, 2021 by the vision and generosity of the Irish Government through its specialist grant department, [Sustainable Finance Skillnet](https://sfskillnet.sustainablefinance.ie/) (SF Skillnet), in partnership with [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) (SFI). See [SF Skillnet Funding Press Release](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/2021/11/03/sustainable-finance-ireland-provides-funding-for-ground-breaking-esg-data-project-to-first-derivative-and-corlytics/)

The funding from SF Skillnet allowed First Derivative and Corlytics to embark on a series of research sprints to develop a plan along with initial research output to set a target for an open-source taxonomy project to benefit all.

## Site Launch - October, 2022
Within one year of our vision and intial funding, we have assembled a group of like-minded partners with the commitment to design, build and maintain a site that we hope will benefit all humankind. We have launched the site from Ireland where the support for sustainable finance is extraordinary from the Irish Government, international organisations and the private sector. Now, the Ireland-based project with expand to have a global impact with contributions from partners in all jurisdictions.

## The Future - January, 2023+
Above all, the site aims to be a practical resource pool for all actors that are active in integrating sustainable finance into the financial services sector. So, the objective for 2023 and beyond, is to keep true to our foundation principles, following our “North Star” of always providing practical tools to create the taxonomy for the data that is necessary to **measure, monitor and manage all facets of sustainability** now and in the future.

## Becoming a Partner
For the moment, we are keeping it simple, with no fees and with candidate partners assessed for membership based on the vlaue they may bring to the project. There are two types of partner offered:
- Contributing Partner: you can immediately bring your contribution to the project;
- Observing Partner: you can follow the project closely by havign access to working groups and special update sessions and, if it suits your organisation, you can convert to a Contributing Partner if and when you feel ready.

## Taxonomy
Regulatory taxonomies have been provided by OS-SFT Componentry Partner, Corlytics. See below for these taxonomies:
* [ISSB Exposure Draft S1](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/general-sustainability-related-disclosures/exposure-draft-ifrs-s1-general-requirements-for-disclosure-of-sustainability-related-financial-information.pdf)
* [ISSB Exposure Draft S2](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/climate-related-disclosures/issb-exposure-draft-2022-2-climate-related-disclosures.pdf)
* [ISSB Expusre Draft S2 Appendix B](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/climate-related-disclosures/issb-exposure-draft-2022-2-appendix-b.pdf)
* [EBA Pillar 3](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Draft%20Technical%20Standards/2022/1026171/EBA%20draft%20ITS%20on%20Pillar%203%20disclosures%20on%20ESG%20risks.pdf)

## Taxonomy Mapping

Mapping exercises have been completed to identify crossovers and differences between ISSB requirements and those of the above reporting regimes.
- Comparisons were made across disclosure requirements spanning governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets including specific GHG emissions and exposure metrics and methodologies.
- This resulted in the identification of potential synergies with current reporting activities and data requirements, including how these might inform asset re-pricing and incorporation of climate risk metrics into existing risk practices. This is of particular interest to the evolving sustainable finance solutions being developed between [First Derivative](https://firstderivative.com/sustainable-finance/), [Corlytics](https://www.corlytics.com/), [Solidatus](https://www.solidatus.com/) and [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) with funding from [Skillnet Ireland](https://www.skillnetireland.ie/).
We see a future where end-to-end, multi-nodal taxonomy mapping becomes central to all operating models for data, risk, controls and reporting.

See below for these mappings, which have been modelled using the data lineage tool provided by OS-SFT Componentry Partner, [Solidatus](https://trial.solidatus.com/viewer/62cc23ee183906050cfcbeae):
