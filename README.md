# OS-SF-Taxonomy-Project-Overview
START HERE: OS-SF Taxonomy Project Background and Overview

## Welcome to the first global project for
# Open-Source Sustainable Finance Taxonomy (OS-SFT)

## Background - July, 2021
The project has its origins in July, 2021 when [First Derivative](https://firstderivative.com/) and [Corlytics](https://www.corlytics.com/) had been researching how best to solve the huge issue of new data requirements for sustainable finance, including the wider ranging domains of Climate Change and ESG. We concluded that the logical way forward was to pursue an open-source agenda to create the foundation taxonomies that would help to drive faster changes in sustainable finance for the financial system.

Inspired by the first global project for open-source climate risk modelling, [OS-Climate](https://os-climate.org/), we embarked on a mission to gather like-minded collaborators to create a critical mass of partners to be able to launch this site.

## Initial Funding - November, 2021
As with all projects of this nature, we needed a catalyst. This was provided in November, 2021 by the vision and generosity of the Irish Government through its specialist grant department, [Sustainable Finance Skillnet](https://sfskillnet.sustainablefinance.ie/) (SF Skillnet), in partnership with [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) (SFI). See [SF Skillnet Funding Press Release](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/2021/11/03/sustainable-finance-ireland-provides-funding-for-ground-breaking-esg-data-project-to-first-derivative-and-corlytics/)

The funding from SF Skillnet allowed First Derivative and Corlytics to embark on a series of research sprints to develop a plan along with initial research output to set a target for an open-source taxonomy project to benefit all.

## Live within 1 Year - October, 2022 - Ireland-based with a Global Impact
Within one year, we assembled a group of like-minded partners with the commitment to design, build and maintain a site that we hope will benefit all humankind. We have launched the site in Ireland where the support for sustainable finance is extraordinary from the Irish Government, international organisations and the private sector.

## 2023 and Beyond
Above all, the site aims to be a practical resource pool for all actors that are active in integrating sustainable finance into the financial services sector. So, the objective for 2023 and beyond, is to keep true to our foundation principles, following our “North Star” of always providing practical tools to create the taxonomy for the data that is necessary to measure, monitor and manage sustainability now and in the future.
