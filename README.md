# Objective - Taxonomy Made Simple
The objective of the project is to provide the marketplace with the following **open-source**, **practical tools** to advance user implementation of sustainable finance data systems into business operating models for new and evolving **taxonomy frameworks, standards, regulations & laws**:

1. **TAXONOMY FILES**: Library of Taxonomy Files - in human and machine readable format
2. **TAXONOMY TOOLS**: Library of Interactive Tools to Explore and Compare Taxonomy Files - for human interaction
3. **TAXONOMY RESEARCH**: Library of Research Papers proving findings, insights and recommendations on evolving Taxonomies
4. **TAXONOMY USE CASES**: Library of Real World Use Cases that explain how to solve specific business problems

## Example: TCFD, EBA and ISSB
1. **TAXONOMY FILES**: TCFD (Framework); EBA Pillar 3 (Regulation); ISSB (Standard)
2. **TAXONOMY TOOLS**: Pairwise Taxonomy Mappings for TCFD-EBA; TCFD-ISSB; EBA-ISSB
3. **TAXONOMY RESEARCH**: Research Paper presenting findings, insights and recommendations of the Mappings Analysis
4. **TAXONOMY USE CASE**: Use Case of End-to-End Lending Workflow under TCFD-EBA-ISSB, where:
    - TCFD is used as part of the Decision Criteria by a Line-of-Business for the Lending;
    - EBA Pillar 3 is used for Mandatory ESG Risk Disclosure for the Lending; and,
    - ISSB is used as the Accounting Standard under IFRS for Financial Statements Balance Sheet Reporting for the Lending
